# yoda-converter
This a really tiny app built on top of AngularJS for demonstration purposes.

All the application does is to let the user enter a sentence written in the active voice and then send that input to an API that will convert it to the passive voice (as Yoda would pronounce it).

The app uses the API "Yoda Speak", created by [ismaelc](https://www.mashape.com/ismaelc) and available at [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/ismaelc/yoda-speak).

To make it work you need to register to [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com) and edit the file `sentence.srv.js` (`LINE 9`) with your own mashape key.

Feel free to clone it and try it out!
